1. for parsing string, we need to have a "buffer" hold characters
that we've seen so far. This is accomplished by defining a string
reference.

2. somehow the order for rules matters. For instance, if I switch
the order of the following two rules:

<STRING>"\""	=> (YYBEGIN INITIAL; Tokens.STRING(!str,!strPos,!strPos+String.size(!str)));
<STRING>.|\n	=> (str := (!str ^ yytext); continue());

then it seems the "\"" will be matched by the second rule and then
every character after that string will be ignored by the scanner.
